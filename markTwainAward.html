                Dave with stand-up comedian Tom Dressen who was a frequent guest on Dave’s talk shows. 
                They met while both were performing at the Comedy Club in Los Angeles in the late 1970’s.

            When David Letterman retired in 2015, he was the longest-running late-night host in television history. 
            Creating an hour-long television show to air five days a week did not leave Dave with a lot of time to reflect 
            on the show’s impact—he was always deeply entrenched on the pressure to make the next episode better.
        </p>
    </div>

        After guest-hosting Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show in 1980, NBC offered Dave an opportunity to host a weekday morning show. 
        The network was taking a big chance with The David Letterman Show. Marked with the lowest morning ratings of any TV network, 
        NBC decided it was time to make a change. NBC was trying out an evening variety show in a time slot normally reserved for game shows.
    </p>

    <div class="side-by-side">
        <p>
            Dave’s morning show had a lot of challenges before it ever hit the air. Variety shows were becoming less
            popular on television, but the network still wanted to follow that format with a regular cast of
            performers on every show. NBC also wanted to add daily gossip, news reports and makeover segments. Dave
            envisioned a talk show similar to Johnny Carson’s. Dave wanted to write comedy skits that would resonate
            with his friends. Different visions between the network and Dave for this new show, a small budget, and a
            production crew that was used to working on game shows, resulted in a lot of tension. Two weeks before the
            show's premiere, the producer quit, leaving the production team, which had minimal live television experience,
            with no one in charge.

                Script from The David Letterman Show. The morning show, cancelled after only four months, was a
                place for Dave and his team to experiment and develop unique ways to fill the 90-minutes of live television.

    <p>
        In the end, The David Letterman Show represented too drastic a change for an audience used to the typical morning
        television programming in the early 1980s, which included mostly game shows and soap operas. Dave’s ironic and cerebral
        humor didn’t resonate with the retirees and housewives that comprised the morning TV audience. The show was cancelled
        after only four months.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the NBC network saw something in Dave. A couple years later, a rare second chance popped up when NBC offered Dave
        another talk show, Late Night with David Letterman. 
    </p>

    <div class="side-by-side">
        <p>
            Airing each night at 12:30 a.m., the new time slot proved to be a better fit for Dave’s humor. A younger, college-aged
            audience embraced the later time slot, Dave’s pranks and his desire to explore the boundaries of late-night TV. The goal
            was to keep the audience guessing as to what would happen next. Everything imaginable happened, from a monkey running
            around the stage with a camera on his back to Dave getting stuck on a Velcro wall while wearing a Velcro suit.

        “I wanted to do a goofy, kind of off-the-wall, innovative show,” Dave said. “I want viewers to feel that anything can
        happen on our show. When there’s real jeopardy, that’s when the fun begins”

        Dave and his production staff worked hard every day to make sure this second chance succeeded. For 11 years, they
        created an innovative show. Late Night with David Letterman was a fresh approach to the familiar talk show format
        created by Johnny Carson. Over eleven years, Dave made stars out of ordinary people like Larry “Bud” Melman, presented
        “Top Ten Lists” and continued to entertain us with “Stupid Pet Tricks.”  Late Night with David Letterman aired on NBC
        from 1982 to 1993.

                Larry “Bud” Melman was sent out on a mission to welcome visitors arriving to New York City at the Port Authority Bus
                Terminal. What ended up was a comedy skit that had Dave laughing hysterically.

                A recurring segment that first appeared on The David Letterman Show, Stupid Pet Tricks was created to fill the
                90-minutes of live television. Over 130 tricks aired over the many years Dave hosted shows.

                When NBC decided not to have Dave replace Johnny Carson when he retired, Dave moved to a different network. The Late
                Show with David Letterman aired on CBS from 1993 until Dave’s retirement in 2015.

                During the 4,261 episodes of his show, Dave interviewed many politicians over the years. Barack Obama, pictured here,
                made three appearances on the show while he was President.
