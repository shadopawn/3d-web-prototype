                They met while both were performing at the Comedy Club in Los Angeles in the late 1970’s.

            When David Letterman retired in 2015, he was the longest-running late-night host in television history. 
            Creating an hour-long television show to air five days a week did not leave Dave with a lot of time to reflect 
            on the show’s impact—he was always deeply entrenched on the pressure to make the next episode better.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        After guest-hosting Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show in 1980, NBC offered Dave an opportunity to host a weekday morning show. 
        The network was taking a big chance with The David Letterman Show. Marked with the lowest morning ratings of any TV network, 
        NBC decided it was time to make a change. NBC was trying out an evening variety show in a time slot normally reserved for game shows.
    </p>

    <div class="side-by-side">
        <p>
            Dave’s morning show had a lot of challenges before it ever hit the air. Variety shows were becoming less
            popular on television, but the network still wanted to follow that format with a regular cast of
            performers on every show. NBC also wanted to add daily gossip, news reports and makeover segments. Dave
            envisioned a talk show similar to Johnny Carson’s. Dave wanted to write comedy skits that would resonate
            with his friends. Different visions between the network and Dave for this new show, a small budget, and a
            production crew that was used to working on game shows, resulted in a lot of tension. Two weeks before the
            show's premiere, the producer quit, leaving the production team, which had minimal live television experience,
            with no one in charge.

                Script from The David Letterman Show. The morning show, cancelled after only four months, was a
                place for Dave and his team to experiment and develop unique ways to fill the 90-minutes of live television.

    <p>
        In the end, The David Letterman Show represented too drastic a change for an audience used to the typical morning
        television programming in the early 1980s, which included mostly game shows and soap operas. Dave’s ironic and cerebral
        humor didn’t resonate with the retirees and housewives that comprised the morning TV audience. The show was cancelled
        after only four months.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the NBC network saw something in Dave. A couple years later, a rare second chance popped up when NBC offered Dave
        another talk show, Late Night with David Letterman. 
    </p>

    <div class="side-by-side">
        <p>
            Airing each night at 12:30 a.m., the new time slot proved to be a better fit for Dave’s humor. A younger, college-aged
            audience embraced the later time slot, Dave’s pranks and his desire to explore the boundaries of late-night TV. The goal
            was to keep the audience guessing as to what would happen next. Everything imaginable happened, from a monkey running
            around the stage with a camera on his back to Dave getting stuck on a Velcro wall while wearing a Velcro suit.

        Dave and his production staff worked hard every day to make sure this second chance succeeded. For 11 years, they
        created an innovative show. Late Night with David Letterman was a fresh approach to the familiar talk show format
        created by Johnny Carson. Over eleven years, Dave made stars out of ordinary people like Larry “Bud” Melman, presented
        “Top Ten Lists” and continued to entertain us with “Stupid Pet Tricks.”  Late Night with David Letterman aired on NBC
        from 1982 to 1993.

                Larry “Bud” Melman was sent out on a mission to welcome visitors arriving to New York City at the Port Authority Bus
                Terminal. What ended up was a comedy skit that had Dave laughing hysterically.

                A recurring segment that first appeared on The David Letterman Show, Stupid Pet Tricks was created to fill the

                When NBC decided not to have Dave replace Johnny Carson when he retired, Dave moved to a different network. The Late
                Show with David Letterman aired on CBS from 1993 until Dave’s retirement in 2015.

                During the 4,261 episodes of his show, Dave interviewed many politicians over the years. Barack Obama, pictured here,

        In the following video, Jimmy Kimmel pays tribute to Dave during the Mark Twain Prize ceremony. From an early age Jimmy
        not only idolized Dave, he also modeled Dave’s career path. Jimmy hosted a local radio show on a college station while
        still in high school. He had several radio jobs before landing a job on a television game show called “Win Ben Stein’s
        Money.” Jimmy’s sophomoric sense of humor complimented the deadpan and stiff delivery of Stein’s. The co-hosting duo
        earned two Daytime Emmys for the show. In 2003 Jimmy was selected to host a late night talk show on ABC called “Jimmy
        Kimmel Live!”

        In 2017, Dave was honored with The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor for his achievements in comedy. Named after
        American humorist Mark Twain, the award recognizes individuals that have significantly influenced American culture.

                Mark Twain is best known for his classic children’s novels Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and the sequel The Adventures
                of Tom Sawyer. Shortly after the Civil War, Twain wrote essays and hosted public lectures about the faraway places he
                traveled. He regularly captivated audiences with eloquently delivered satire. His talks provided a window of opportunity
                for the audience to travel along with him to foreign places. Mark Twain’s books still influence American culture today.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Just as Twain provided a front-row seat to his traveling adventures, Letterman invited audiences to travel with him as
        he created a new formula of “anything goes” for talk-shows. During 33 years of late-night television, Dave constantly
        satirized the medium as he was breaking the rules. He had a midwestern indifference to his success and fame, and he
        frequently mocked his own show. Objects were tossed from a rooftop just for the absurd visual as they hit the pavement.
        He often yelled out of office windows with a bull-horn to those passing down below. Dave also changed the model for
        late-night talk shows. He included more sketches. He extended the show beyond the interview desk and guest chair with
        frequent remote drop-ins to visit everyday people like the deli owner next door. Dave included a musical guest almost
        every night.

                Needing to find unique ways to fill 90-minutes of live television, Dave’s morning show provided a great space for
                discovery. Although cancelled after only four months, this failure early in Dave’s career may have actually led to his
                later success. Many of the writers, directors, guests, and innovative comedy segments that would play large parts
                throughout his career were introduced on The David Letterman Show. “Small Town News,” “Stupid Pet Tricks,” Stage Manager
                Biff Henderson, along with guests Bill Murray, Steve Martin, and Andy Kaufman all were part of the morning show
                experiment.

        Dave’s ironic humor and edgy comedy style was better suited for late-night television. For 33 years he always kept the
        audience guessing as to what they would see on the show. From rotating the screen a full 360 degrees slowly throughout
        the show, to having a monkey run around the studio wearing a camera, or filming remote segments, Dave was always
        innovating and pushing comedy to the edge on his shows. 
    </p>

    <p>
        With a record breaking 6,028 episodes on NBC and then CBS Dave, surpassed the lengthy tenure of his mentor, Johnny
        Carson. Dave’s innovative comedy impacted pop culture. But he is also known for his serious monologues, especially the
        one he delivered soon after 9/11. He let us all know it was okay to laugh again after this tragedy. His hour-long themed
        shows, wearing suits made out of Alka-Seltzer while being lowered into water, and hosting a show on an airplane flying
        from New York City to Miami, constantly innovated late-night television. Dave not only influenced American culture, his
        influence is also reflected throughout the current late-night talk shows.
