                Dave with stand-up comedian Tom Dressen who was a frequent guest on Dave’s talk shows. 
                They met while both were performing at the Comedy Club in Los Angeles in the late 1970’s.

            When David Letterman retired in 2015, he was the longest-running late-night host in television history. 
            Creating an hour-long television show to air five days a week did not leave Dave with a lot of time to reflect 
            on the show’s impact—he was always deeply entrenched on the pressure to make the next episode better.

        After guest-hosting Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show in 1980, NBC offered Dave an opportunity to host a weekday morning show. 
        The network was taking a big chance with The David Letterman Show. Marked with the lowest morning ratings of any TV network, 
        NBC decided it was time to make a change. NBC was trying out an evening variety show in a time slot normally reserved for game shows.

            Dave’s morning show had a lot of challenges before it ever hit the air. Variety shows were becoming less
            popular on television, but the network still wanted to follow that format with a regular cast of
            performers on every show. NBC also wanted to add daily gossip, news reports and makeover segments. Dave
            envisioned a talk show similar to Johnny Carson’s. Dave wanted to write comedy skits that would resonate
            with his friends. Different visions between the network and Dave for this new show, a small budget, and a
            production crew that was used to working on game shows, resulted in a lot of tension. Two weeks before the
            show's premiere, the producer quit, leaving the production team, which had minimal live television experience,
            with no one in charge.

                Script from The David Letterman Show. The morning show, cancelled after only four months, was a
                place for Dave and his team to experiment and develop unique ways to fill the 90-minutes of live television.
