        <p>David Letterman is well known for his dry, often goofy, and regularly self-deprecating brand of humor. But, the truth is that Dave is among some of the country’s all-time most influential and famous comedians. In 2012, Dave was honored among a small group of talented individuals when he was awarded the Kennedy Center Honor.</p>

    <p>The Kennedy Center Honors advisory committee felt differently when they awarded Dave this honor. The rainbow ribbon symbolizes the many skills within the performing arts and the spectrum of individuals that have received the award. The Kennedy Center Honor is one of the nation’s highest awards given to individuals. Dave was recognized for his lifetime contributions to American culture with his 33 years of hosting late night television shows. </p>
    <p>The rainbow colors on the Kennedy Center Honor represent the many skills within the performing arts. Started in 1978, the Kennedy Center Honors is one of the most respected awards given to performers. Dave’s shows helped launch the careers of many comedians and musicians. And by interviewing many political leaders over the years, Dave also brought attention to important topics such as world hunger and climate change. </p>

    <p>After Dave retired from The Late Show in 2015, he donated many personal items to his alma mater Ball State University. His Kennedy Center Honor is now part of the David Letterman Collection at Bracken Library.</p>
    <p>The Kennedy Center Honor is presented over a weekend-long ceremony. The event includes the Chairman's Luncheon, State Department dinner, White House reception, and the taped Honors gala performances followed by a dinner. </p>

    <p>Dave wasn’t the first late-night talk show host honored by the Kennedy Center. In fact, Dave’s idol and mentor, Johnny Carson, received the honors in 1993, and Dave was on hand to help present the award.  </p>

    <p>Dave’s absurdist humor built on Carson’s talk show format; but in many ways, Dave was a pioneer. From Stupid Pet Tricks to his iconic Top-Ten lists, Dave influenced many hosts and comedians that came after him, including Jimmy Kimmel and Ray Romano. </p>
