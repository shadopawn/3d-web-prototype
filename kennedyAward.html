        <p>David Letterman is well known for his dry, often goofy, and regularly self-deprecating brand of humor. But, the truth is that Dave is among some of the country’s all-time most influential and famous comedians. In 2012, Dave was honored among a small group of talented individuals when he was awarded the Kennedy Center Honor.</p>
