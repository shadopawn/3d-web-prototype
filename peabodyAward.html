    <h1 class="smaller-heading">Radio: Dave’s introduction to comedy</h1>
    <div class="side-by-side">
        <p>
            It is fitting that Dave would be acknowledged for an award that recognizes the power of telling stories on the radio. Dave’s
            first love was radio. While growing up in Indiana in the late 1940s and 1950s, the Letterman family did not own a television
            set. Dave has fond memories of listening to the radio with his dad. They both enjoyed the radio show <cite>Monitor</cite> that
            featured the comedy team of Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding. The two comedians had a dry wit and hosted a serious radio program
            while parodying other radio shows like soap operas and game shows. “It was the first time our sense of humor overlapped,” Dave
            said speaking of his dad. <cite>Monitor</cite> included absurd sketches that made fun of reporting by imitating an anchorman’s
            delivery.

            <p>
                Living on the Northside of Indianapolis in Broad Ripple, Dave grew up like many young Hoosiers, playing baseball and
                basketball. The Letterman family from left to right is sister Jan, David, mother Dorothy, dad Joe, and sister Gretchen in
                front.

    <p>
        In middle school, Dave and his friends recorded shows on a reel-to-reel machine, satirizing television shows like <cite>Leave It to
        Beaver</cite> and <cite>The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet</cite>.
    </p>

    <div class="side-by-side">

            <img alt="Letterman as a disc jockey" src="./assets/images/peabodyAward/pb-02.jpg">
            <p>
                Before getting fired, Dave was a disc jockey on the student run Ball State radio station WBST. He played classical music
                from
                records and was part of a nine-man news team that reported election results.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            In college at Ball State University, Dave’s first broadcasting job was at the school radio station, WBST, which played classical
            music. Dave hosted a musical show for which he wrote background information to go along with the music and the composers. It
            didn’t take him long to become bored and start making up stories about the composers. Dave was quickly fired. Not long after his
            dismissal, he was asked to come back because the station was short-staffed, and he was a popular disc jockey. Student manager Al
            Rent thought Dave might get into less trouble if they had him read news from the AP wire. “In hindsight, what was I thinking?”
            Rent later said. “Like he wouldn’t embellish the news?” Dave announced fake scores from made-up sports leagues, wrote
            counterfeit stories, and eventually was fired once again.
        </p>
    </div>


    <p>
        After graduating from Ball State in 1969, Dave landed a job at Indianapolis’ television station WLWI. There, Dave was a weekend
        weatherman, anchorman, and host of a Saturday morning kids program. His wacky and irrelevant sense of humor continued in front of TV
        cameras. As a weekend weatherman, Dave predicted “hailstones the size of canned hams,” and announced his displeasure at a satellite
        photo that erased part of Indiana’s border.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
        Although Dave’s humor at the college radio station did not fit with some of the faculty’s visions at Ball State, his knack for
        making up funny stories at WLWI was encouraged. Unfortunately, when a full-time weather position became available, the station
        wanted someone with more professional forecasting credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Soon, Dave transitioned back to radio and began writing satirical sketches where he parodied news anchors, salesmen, and psychics.
        After the death of his father, Dave decided to pursue a permanent career in television. He continued to work for two more years at
        radio stations in Indianapolis, save up some money, and then follow his television dreams.

        <p>
            Dave took his writing skills, his dry wit, and his satire to California in 1975. Shortly after arriving, Dave performed stand-up
            at the famous Comedy Store. He performed alongside other new comedians like Jay Leno, Richard Pryor, Andy Kaufman, and
            Robin Williams. The Comedy Store was the place to perform if you wanted to get noticed by booking agents from <cite>The Tonight
            Show</cite>. After working a decade at local television and radio stations, Dave was calm and relaxed in front of a
            microphone. His observational humor often included parodying familiar topics from his local television news days. He poked fun
            at TV station managers who occasionally appeared on camera to tape on-air editorial opinions on serious topics. Of course, Dave
            made up funny content using quirky language to get the audience laughing, such as the following:
        </p>
    </div>


    <q class="quote">
        We here at Channel 13 would like to take this opportunity to say that we are diametrically opposed to the practice of
        using orphans as yardage markers in driving ranges.
    </q>


    <p class="medium-margin-top">
        A booking agent from <cite>The Tonight Show</cite> saw Dave perform at The Comedy Store and invited him to appear as a
        guest on <cite>The Tonight Show</cite> with Johnny Carson. Dave made his first appearance on November 24, 1978.
    </p>

                title="YouTube video player"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        After his set, Dave received the praise every stand-up comic was looking for, an invitation from Carson to join him for an
        interview. Dave ended the interview by referencing his local TV news days in Indiana where station managers would tape on-camera
        editorials about serious issues. Dave’s love of funny sounding words was incorporated into his joke as he said, “We here at Channel
        13 would like to take this opportunity to say that we are diametrically opposed to the practice of using orphans as yardage markers
        in driving ranges.” The audience acknowledged Dave with applause and laughter. At the end of the interview, Carson mentioned to both
        Dave and the audience that he thought Dave would be working a lot and not just at The Comedy Store, after this
        successful appearance on <cite>The Tonight Show</cite>. Not only would Dave appear on <cite>The Tonight Show</cite> more than 20
        times, he would occasionally serve as a guest host when Carson was on vacation. The appearances on <cite>The Tonight Show</cite>
        helped place Dave as a rising comic and possible television star in the eyes of NBC network executives.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1982, Dave hosted his own late-night talk show that aired each night right after <cite>The Tonight Show</cite>. Dave modeled part
        of his own talk show after Carson’s format. However, he was not permitted to produce a carbon copy of <cite>The Tonight Show</cite>,
        as Carson Productions limited what <cite>Late Night with David Letterman</cite> could do.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, <cite>Late Night</cite> was not permitted to have an Ed McMahon-style sidekick, a big band, or regular <cite>Tonight
        Show</cite> guests. Dave was also required to prepare shorter monologues that could not include topical jokes from the current
        news.
    </p>

    <div class="side-by-side">

            <img alt="Top 10 List" src="./assets/images/peabodyAward/pb-05.jpg">
            <p>
                Dave’s talk-shows often included The Top 10 Lists that were typed on blue note cards. The short one-liners about a single
                category showcased Dave’s smart and edgy humor.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The restrictions forced Dave and his staff to become innovative and create a looser, free-spirited show that included newer
                celebrities as guests. Paul Schaffer served as a leader of a four-piece band, as well as the occasional comedy partner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dave, always an observationalist humorist, introduced monologues about everyday observations and included regular comedy
                segments
                like The Top 10 List into his show. He introduced late-night audiences to his irrelevant humor through various tactics,
                including
                placing cameras on monkeys, throwing various items off of buildings, Stupid Pet Tricks, and yelling out of windows with
                megaphones
                to unsuspecting passersby below.

    <p>
        After Carson retired in 1993, Dave was not asked to succeed him as host of <cite>The Tonight Show</cite>. As a result, Dave moved to
        a different network. Dave’s new show, <cite>Late Show</cite>, became the first successful late-night comedy show for CBS. Both talk
        shows were inventive and imaginative and showcased Dave’s absurdist humor. For 33 years over the two late-night shows, Dave
        interviewed celebrities and politicians while changing the culture of comedy talk shows and our nation’s pop culture, all while
        creating a blueprint that is still followed by current hosts of late-night talk shows. When he retired in 2015, Dave had hosted
        6,080 episodes of <cite>Late Night</cite> and <cite>Late Show</cite>, setting a record as a late-night talk show on television.

    <h2 class="smaller-heading">The Peabody Award</h2>

    <q class="quote">
        In 2015, Dave was awarded an Individual Peabody Award for “reshaping the tone and form of late-night entertainment.

    <div class="side-by-side medium-margin-top">
        <p>
            The Peabody Award, established by the National Association of Broadcasters, was first introduced in 1941 to honor powerful and
            invigorating stories in radio. By 1948, with television becoming a rapidly growing storytelling platform, the award included
            television shows and personalities. Named after investment banker George Peabody, the award recognizes seven categories: news,
            entertainment, documentaries, children’s programming, education, interactive programming, and public service.

            <p>
                Over the course of his career, Dave exercised his dry wit and satire and became a masterful storyteller, just like the
                comedy team of Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding did on their radio show <cite>Monitor</cite>. The dry witted comedy team
                satirized other serious radio programs like soap operas and game shows. While growing up in Indiana the Letterman family did
                not own a television set when Dave was young. Dave and his dad both enjoyed listening to the comedian's parodies on the
                radio and it was the first time their sense of humor overlapped.

        After Dave retired in 2015, he was honored with an individual Peabody Award for his many years of telling powerful stories in
        late-night television. Dave’s individual Peabody Award is part of the collection he donated to Ball State University.
